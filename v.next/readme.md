note: this folder contains the work in progress for version 1.0, stuff in here contains unfixed and unknown bugs and the library versions contained in the samples might (are!) be slightly out of sync.

the dataformat of the layers will change in v1.0 (and layers will become much faster), use layermaker2 to create the new layers, this tool still dumps loads of debug info, and the dataformat might change again before 1.0.
fonts, sprites and videos will support temporal dithering for real grayscale display on the ssd1306, the tools still need cleanup and command line interface before release
